# GN-ACCESSING
Currently, we provide codes for evaluating the UAV energy consumption minimization performance of CBWF and Linear Boundary in the simulation scenario.

cvx_test.m and psotsp.m are the two main functions, which can provide the simulation results of UAV energy minimization and energy-efficient path planning, respectively.

You can also adjust the parameters in the code to obtain the minimum UAV energy consumption and the minimum number of UAVs in multi-UAV GN-accessing tasks for any scenario.

If our paper is accepted, we will open source all the code.
